# Git Commands
*Explain the gitFlow workflow and have a section to define and give examples of how to use the following*

### Repository
* A repository holds all the files and revision history for a project on GitHub. Repositories can be individual or shared for collaboration, as well as public or private depending on the project.

### Clone
* The clone command is used to duplicate a repository. Cloning creates a local copy of a repository that can be synced with the remote repository on Github. This can be done through HTTPS, which is the web address of the repository, or using an SSH key, which is an encryption method that allows for authentication of a remote computer and user.

### Fork
* The fork command creates a copy of a repository. Forking is used to allow the user to manipulate the code without affecting the original project. This is most commonly used to test potential changes to another user’s project, or to use existing code as a base for a new idea.

### Branch
* Branches are used to create a separate environment for development work within the repository that will not affect other branches. All repositories have one master branch, and can have many different branches.

### Commit
* Commits are all the tracked saved changes made within a branch. Commits show the specific changes, who made them, and when. Comments can be made on commits for organizational purposes.

### Merge
* Merges allow a user to apply changes from one branch to another. This can happen through a pull request or the command line.

### Checkout
* The checkout command allows users to navigate between different branches. Checking out a branch updates all files in the working directory to match the version within that branch, as well as record all new commits.

### Push
* Push is used to push commits on a local branch to a remote repository. The push command requires two arguments, a remote name and a branch name.

### Pull
* Pull is used to get all changes from the remote repository onto the local repository. The pull command combines fetch, which retrieves changes, and merge, which combines the local and remote changes.
