# Git Commands
*Explain the gitFlow workflow and have a section to define and give examples of how to use the following*

### Repository
* A repository holds all the files and revision history for a project on GitHub. Repositories can be individual or shared for collaboration, as well as public or private depending on the project.

### Clone
* The clone command is used to duplicate a repository. Cloning creates a local copy of a repository that can be synced with the remote repository on Github. This can be done through HTTPS, which is the web address of the repository, or using an SSH key, which is an encryption method that allows for authentication of a remote computer and user.
