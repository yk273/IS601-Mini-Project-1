# Project Description

Git: 
* Git can be used to improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company through streamlining the coding process. Git becomes a central hub for easy code collaboration ideal for work projects. The branching and merging features are one of the biggest collaborative assets in Git, as branching allows independent development and merging makes it simple to combine individual work into the whole. Additionally, Git is free and open source so it greatly benefits businesses at no cost to them. 

Docker:
* Docker is important to business processes since it allows for easier creation, deployment, and running applications through using containers. Containers are significantly better than virtual machines, as they are isolated but share the OS and file libraries instead of emulating virtual hardware- which means significantly less system requirements.

Continuous Integration: 
* Continuous integration is another advantageous business process, which is made significantly easier through the use of Docker. Docker makes continuous integration easier by increasing portability by using containers for developer’s applications, which means their code is isolated so it is easier to push modifications and updates. Docker also allows developers to easily test their work in multiple different environments through containers. 

Automated Testing: 
* Automated testing can be done through an application called Travis CI. A build can be automatically tested when Travis CI clones the repository into a virtual environment, then runs specified tests in order to test the code. The code will either break, in which case the user will be notified of the failure, or it will be passed and deployed. This is important to businesses, as they can quickly and easily test their code before deployment. By simplifying the process, it allows for faster deployment and therefore an increase in competitiveness.
