# Mini Project Two Defintions and Examples

## Python uses Identation to Control Flow
* Python controls flow through indentation by using whitespace characters, which are spaces or tabs, to delimit scope. The standard is four spaces to show proper indentation, but at minimum Python requires one whitespace character.

## Don't Repeat Yourself
* Don’t Repeat Yourself, or the DRY principle, aims to remove all code duplication through either abstraction or automation in order to produce an efficient, logically sound program. 

## Design Patterns from Gang of Four
* The Gang of Four have three main design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. 
	* Creational patterns focus on object creation, rather than instantiating objects directly. 
	* Structural patterns deal with class and object composition through inheritance in order to create relationships that can form larger structures.
	* Behavioral patterns target increasing the communication between objects through how they interact.
