# Mini Project Two Defintions and Examples

## Python uses Identation to Control Flow
* Python controls flow through indentation by using whitespace characters, which are spaces or tabs, to delimit scope. The standard is four spaces to show proper indentation, but at minimum Python requires one whitespace character.

## Don't Repeat Yourself
* Don’t Repeat Yourself, or the DRY principle, aims to remove all code duplication through either abstraction or automation in order to produce an efficient, logically sound program. 

## Design Patterns from Gang of Four
* The Gang of Four have three main design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. 
	* Creational patterns focus on object creation, rather than instantiating objects directly. 
	* Structural patterns deal with class and object composition through inheritance in order to create relationships that can form larger structures.
	* Behavioral patterns target increasing the communication between objects through how they interact.

## Class
* A class determines the contents of an object, and how it will behave through defining variables and methods.

## Object
* An object consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Objects often model things that can be found in the “real world”. Objects also determine the behavior of the class.

## Static
* A static method is a method that belongs to a class definition rather than an object. Static methods can be called without creating an object for that class.

## Property
* A property has a getter and setter method to access encapsulated data, such as class data. The main purpose of the property function is to create a property of a class.

## Attribute
* Attributes store information about instances, and there are two types of attributes.
	* Class Attributes belong to classes, and are shared by all instances. 
	* Instance Attributes can have their own attributes, and are not shared by objects.

## Method
* Methods accept parameters as their arguments, manipulate the data, and then produce an output when called.

## Exception
* An exception is something that disrupts the execution of a program.

## Unit Test
* A unit test is code written to test the behavior and functionality of other code.

## Constructor
* A constructor is a method that initializes an object after it has been created.

## Factory
* A factory method  is a creational pattern in which an object can be created without determining the exact class of object that will be created.

## Decorator
* A decorator is a wrapper that allows the execution of code before and after the function that is being decorated without modifying the function in order to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

## Extend Class
* An extended class is a subclass of a superclass. Extended subclasses can use, modify, or override the items inherited from the superclass.

## CSV Files
* A comma-separated value file is a delimited text file that stores data in plain text.

## Reading Files
* Code can be used to manipulate text files, such as reading and writing to the files.
