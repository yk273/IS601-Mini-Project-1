# Linux Commands 

### **cd**
* **cd**: Change Directory
* This command changes the working directory to the directory specified by the user. Here is an example of a current working directory, and how it can be changed within the command line. This will move the user "down" the directory.

* Another way to navigate is moving "up" the directory. This is done by using **cd ../** to move the directory "up" by one, **cd ../..** to move the directory "up by two, etc.

### mkdir
* **mkdir**: Make Directory
* This command creates a new directory specified with a name (directories can also be referred to as a folders). In this example, a new directory named "Pastels" in the folder "Mediums" is created. The command ls (which lists all files and and folders in the current directory) now lists "Pastels" among the other directories.
